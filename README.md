## Frontend developer test

##### Your test is to consume the public [Flickr API](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json) and display the results according to this basic wireframe:

Please find our requirements listed below:

* The website you create should function as a [single page application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).
* Because of the tech stack used by Uplifter, this should be completed using ReactJS.
* Your app must be fully responsive across all devices and screen sizes.
* Your app should support all the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE11+).
* If you decide to use other Flickr API feeds, please note that some endpoints require an API key. You can apply for your own [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys).
* Where possible, only request images with a 'safe' tag to ensure the application remains suitable for all ages.
* Code should be pushed to a git repository.

If you feel like you want to go the extra mile, here is a list of potential additions:

* Think about how you might improve the speed of the page in terms of the images/content loading.
* Allow the page to have an infinite scroll (loading in more images as you scroll).
* A search functionality based on tags, or possibly the title of the photo.
* How you can add in smooth animations that will add to the value of the application.
* Alternatively if you can think of any other features that you feel would further enhance your app, then we'd love to see what you can come up with!
